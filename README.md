# Zenith Wellness: Portfolio Website Project

This project showcases a fully designed and implemented portfolio website for a hypothetical company, Zenith Wellness, a platform offering mental wellness resources.

## Key Technologies & Design Approach:
   1. **UI/UX Design with Figma**:  The entire website was designed in Figma *before* any code was written. This allowed for a comprehensive approach to:
    •   *User Flows*: Mapping out intuitive paths for users to achieve their goals, whether it's learning about a specific service or contacting a therapist.
    •   *Wireframing*:  Creating low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic layout and content hierarchy, ensuring a clear and logical structure.
    •   *Prototyping*:  Developing interactive prototypes to test the user experience and identify potential usability issues before investing in development.
    •   *Visual Design*: Crafting a consistent and visually appealing aesthetic that aligns with the wellness theme, incorporating calming colors, appropriate typography, and engaging imagery.  This includes careful consideration of whitespace, visual hierarchy, and overall brand consistency.
  2. **HTML5**:  The core structure of the website is built with semantic HTML5 elements, ensuring accessibility and SEO optimization.
  3. **CSS3**: Styling is implemented using CSS3, incorporating modern techniques for layout, visual appeal, and responsiveness.  Media queries are strategically used to ensure the website adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
